# DeepFlaky-Deep-Hybrid-Representation-Learning-for-Flaky-Test-Prediction
DeepFlaky is a novel framework that accurately predicts flaky tests by fusing expert-defined features with deep semantic features from CodeBERT, and enhancing the representation through contrastive learning. 

## Project Overview
This project is the code implementation corresponding to the paper "DeepFlaky Deep Hybrid Representation Learning for Flaky Test Prediction". The paper proposes a novel framework for detecting flaky tests. By fusing expert-defined features with deep semantic features from CodeBERT, and enhancing the representation through contrastive learning, it improves the precision of detection.

## Environment Requirements
The dependencies required to run the project can be installed using the `requirements.txt` file. Use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the project, you can follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
2. Ensure you have the necessary configurations set in `DeepFlaky-RQ1.py`, `DeepFlaky-RQ2.py`, `DeepFlaky-RQ3-contrastive learning.py` and `DeepFlaky-RQ3-without contrastive learning.py`. You may need to adjust paths or parameters according to your environment and dataset.
3. Execute the script:
   ```bash
   python `DeepFlaky-RQ1.py`
   python `DeepFlaky-RQ2.py`
   python `DeepFlaky-RQ3-contrastive learning.py`
   python `DeepFlaky-RQ3-without contrastive learning.py`
   ```
4. The results will be saved in the `result-RQ1`, `result-RQ2` and `result-RQ3`directory.
